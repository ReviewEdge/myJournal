We will write the backend for a social journaling app that does the following:
	- Allows user to create an account.
		- Accounts can be followed.
		- Account profile information can be edited.
		- Creates an individualized feed based on followed accounts/journals.
	- Allows user to create journals.
		- Journals can be public or private.
		- Journals can have multiple contributors.
		- Journals can be followed.
		- Journals keep track of likes and views.
	- Allows user to write pages in journals.
		- Pages keep track of likes and views.
	- Interacts with database
	- Has network endpoints
	- A basic terminal frontend will be created:
		- That will allow user to interact with backend as described above
		- A GUI will NOT be created (unless we finish backend early)
